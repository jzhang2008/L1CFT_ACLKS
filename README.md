# L1CFT_ACLKS
This MATLAB code implements the proposed method (L1CFT_ACLKS)in the paper: ¡°Sparse Regularized Correlation Filter for UAV Object Tracking with adaptive Contextual Learning and Keyfilter Selection¡±.

Installation: To be able to run the "mexResize" function, try to use either one of the included mex-files or compile one of your own. OpenCV is needed for this. The existing compile scripts "compilemex.m" or "compilemex_win.m" can be modified for this purpose.

Instructions:

Run the "run_tracker.m" script in MATLAB. or you may need to  download the related datasets
